# Vaccine_preventable_Deaths
Ghafari et al.: A quantitative evaluation of the impact of vaccine roll-out rate and coverage on reducing deaths from COVID-19: a counterfactual study on the impact of the delayed vaccination programme in Iran.

## Files
Files include daily (`*_fullyvaxed.txt`) and age-stratified (`*_vax_pergroup2.txt`) number of fully vaccinated individuals per country. Also includes Iran's demographics (`iran's demography from 1398 to 1400 solar hijri.xlsx`). Reported daily number of fully vaccinated individuals can be downloaded from [Our World in Data ](https://ourworldindata.org/) and is named `OWD_data.xlsx` in the Mathematica code (`modelling_counterfactuals_final.nb`).
